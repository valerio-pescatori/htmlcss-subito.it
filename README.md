# Subito.it HTML5 + CSS3 clone

Small front-end project that consist of a clone of the [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it/) homepage.

The webpage is made using exclusively HTML5 and CSS3, no JS.

While writing CSS I tried to apply the BEM methodology to keep the stylesheet organized as much as possible.
